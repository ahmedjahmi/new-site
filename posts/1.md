## Scenario:

You're listening to Jay-Z's song "Marcy Me" and you notice he says:

> "Shoutout to Nostrand Ave., Flushing Ave., Myrtle. All the County of Kings, may your grounds stay fertile."

Your bestfriend lives in Brooklyn (Kings County) on Nostrand Ave., so you think he'd get excited to hear that Jay-Z gave him a shoutout. Naturally, you want to share the song with a him.

## The Problem:

You're listening to the song on Apple Music but your friend is an avid Spotify fanatic. If you send him an Apple Music link, he will surely end your friendship because you should already know his position and there is nothing he can do with that link, other than make note of the song to look up later.

Similarly, that problem exists for you as well when he sends you a Spotify link.

Hmm, well what if there was a magic SongLink Converter you can use to send your friend a Spotify link from Apple Music? Or, open a Spotify link sent from your friend, in Apple Music?

That would be amazing. Let's make that magic SongLink Converter a reality using the Apple Shortcuts app!

Luckily for us, there is a project called [odesli.co](https://odesli.co/) that allows you to paste a song link from _any_ major platform into their search bar and generates links for that song on **_every_** major platform. Thankfully, they have an open API that we can utilize in our shortcut. All we need to do is make a request to that api endpoint that contains our song link as a url query parameter.

Let's get to it..

First, let's take a look at the Apple Shortcuts app. It gives us the ability to run tasks that comprise of _actions_. An _action_ is similar to a _function_ or _method_ in various programming languages like JavaScript or Python. These _actions_ take input and return output, giving you the ability to interact with apps and content on your iOS device, as well as content and services on the web. More detailed information on Shortcuts [here](https://support.apple.com/guide/shortcuts/welcome/4.0/ios).

## How will our shortcut work?

### Two Use Cases:

1. The user is listening to a song on one platform, and they want to share it to a user of another platform.

2. The user receives a song link to another platform, and they want to open it within the platform they use.

### Steps:

1. Handle whether the song link is coming from an app or copied to the clipboard.
   - Store the link in a `UrlQuery` variable.
2. Store the [odesli.co](https://odesli.co/) api endpoint as a variable called `SongLinkApi`.
3. Create a url using the `SongLinkApi` and `UrlQuery` and store it in an `ApiCall` variable.
4. Make a request to the `ApiCall` url and store the dictionary returned by the request in a variable called `Data`.
5. Create a list of platforms from which the user can choose.
   - Allow the user to choose a platform from the platform list.
   - Store that choice in a `Platform` variable.
6. Get the value of the link we want to share from the `Data`.
   - Store that value in a `ShareLink` variable.
7. Present a menu that offers the options to '_Open_' the `ShareLink` or '_Send in message_'.
   - If they choose to '_Open_', open the link in Safari.
   - If they choose to '_Send in message_', present a message populated with the `ShareLink` allowing the user to choose a _Recipient_ and send it.

Let's get to it!

### **1. Handle whether the song link is coming from an app or copied to the clipboard.**

First, open the Shortcuts app. Click the '+' icon to add a new shortcut.

![Add new shortcut](https://res.cloudinary.com/ds2pg7vex/image/upload/v1620336071/ahmed-jahmi-blog/post_1_image_1_yyb3jl.jpg)

We'll need to add a conditional statement here. An "if" statement. Is the song link coming from an app? If so, do this. Otherwise, do that. So, let's add the "_**If**_" action.

![Added If Action](https://res.cloudinary.com/ds2pg7vex/image/upload/v1620336950/ahmed-jahmi-blog/post_1_image_2_hq5rgj.jpg)

We notice that the **_If_** action has two parameters: **_Input_** and **_Condition_**. Let's click into **_Input_**. We're given some arguments that you can pass into the **_Input_** parameter. Let's choose the variable `Shortcut Input`.

![Passing Shortcut Input variable to If action Input parameter](https://res.cloudinary.com/ds2pg7vex/image/upload/v1620337300/ahmed-jahmi-blog/post_1_image_3_jpegxh.jpg)

Next, we want to click the **_Condition_** parameter. We're given two arguments to choose from. We'll choose the '_does not have any value_' condition.

![Passing the does not have any value argument to the If action Condition parameter](https://res.cloudinary.com/ds2pg7vex/image/upload/v1620338074/ahmed-jahmi-blog/post_1_image_4_kgzpkz.jpg)

If our condition returns true, the `Shortcut Input` variable indeed has no value. In that case, we'll want to set whatever is in our `Clipboard` to a variable we can use later.

Let's do this by adding the **_Set variable_** action, naming it `UrlQuery` and setting the variable to `Clipboard`.

![Setting a variable called UrlQuery to the value of the Clipboard](https://res.cloudinary.com/ds2pg7vex/image/upload/v1620338932/ahmed-jahmi-blog/post_1_image_5_kxpah7.jpg)

This handles the case where we have no value in `Shortcut Input`, but what if we do? We can handle that in the **_Otherwise_** section of the **_If_** action. Let's add a **_Set variable_** action after **_Otherwise_**, name it `UrlQuery` as well, and set it to the value of the `Shortcut Input` variable.

![Setting a variable called UrlQuery to the value of Shortcut Input in the Otherwise section of the If action](https://res.cloudinary.com/ds2pg7vex/image/upload/v1620343968/ahmed-jahmi-blog/post_1_image_6_lgctzm.jpg)

### 2. Store the [odesli.co](https://odesli.co/) api endpoint as a variable called `SongLinkApi`.

If we take a look at Odesli's [api documentation](https://www.notion.so/API-d0ebe08a5e304a55928405eb682f6741), they provide the api endpoint:

```
https://api.song.link/v1-alpha.1/links?
```

To set a variable to a string, we'll need to first add the **_Text_** action. Paste in our api endpoint url. Then add a **_Set variable_** action, naming it `SongLinkApi` and setting it to the value of the **_Text_** action.

![Setting the SongLinkApi variable to the Text action that contains the api endpoint url](https://res.cloudinary.com/ds2pg7vex/image/upload/v1620345357/ahmed-jahmi-blog/post_1_image_7_yt316x.jpg)

### 3. Create a url using the `SongLinkApi` and `UrlQuery` and store it in an `ApiCall` variable.

According to the Odesli [api documentation](https://www.notion.so/API-d0ebe08a5e304a55928405eb682f6741), the api endpoint we have stored in our `SongLinkApi` variable will be the start of the url we need to make our api call.

The next part of the api call url will be it's query parameter(s). It accepts a few query parameters, but we're only concerned with the `url` one for our shortcut. And the value we need is stored in our `UrlQuery` variable. We preface our `UrlQuery` with `url=` as that is the `url` param's key. Without the key, the endpoint wouldnt recognize our `UrlQuery` as a `url` param.

Let's combine our variables into the complete URL we need to make the api call. We'll do this using the **_Text_** and **_Set variable_** actions like we did in the step before, but in this **_Text_** action we'll add our `SongLinkApi`, the `url` parameter key `url=`, then our `UrlQuery` variable. Then we'll **_Set variable_** to the value of **_Text_**, and name it `ApiCall`.

![Setting the ApiCall variable to the Text action which contains the SongLinkApi, url key, and UrlQuery](https://res.cloudinary.com/ds2pg7vex/image/upload/v1620346853/ahmed-jahmi-blog/post_1_image_8_plawjo.jpg)

### 4. Make a request to the `ApiCall` url and store the dictionary returned by the request in a variable called `Data`.

Now that we have our `ApiCall` URL, we can make a request to the Odesli api for the data of the song we want returned.

We'll do this by adding the **_Get contents of URL_** action. This action has a URL parameter, so we'll pass it our `ApiCall` variable.

After the request is made, the api returns a dictionary full of data. We want to store that data in a variable. Let's add a **_Set variable_** action, name it `Data` and set it to the **_Contents of URL_** action.

![Gettings the contents of ApiCall and setting the variable Data to the value of the response to ApiCall](https://res.cloudinary.com/ds2pg7vex/image/upload/v1620348784/ahmed-jahmi-blog/post_1_image_9_uilyma.jpg)

Here's an example of what the `Data` looks like:

            "entityUniqueId": "AMAZON_SONG::B01NAE38YO"
        }
    }
}
```

Now that we have our data, we need to filter through it to return the URL of the platform the user needs. To do that, we need to provide the user with a list of platforms from which to choose.

### 5. Create a list of platforms from which the user can choose.

Odesli provides links for the pretty much every platform you can think of:

- spotify
- appleMusic
- tidal
- deezer
- youtube
- youtubeMusic
- google
- googleStore
- amazonMusic
- amazonStore
- soundcloud
- pandora
- yandex
- spinrilla
- audius

You'll notice, all the options are in camelCase. This is because they will serve as keys in our nested dictionary stored in our `Data` variable.

Let's create this list of platform choices by adding the **_List_** action. In the list, add each platform as a list item, remembering to format them in camelCase.

![List action with each platform as items](https://res.cloudinary.com/ds2pg7vex/image/upload/v1620349750/ahmed-jahmi-blog/post_1_image_10_dq3t71.jpg)

Now that we have our list, we want the allow the user to choose from the list. For this, we have the **_Choose from List_** action. You can add a prompt to indicate to the user what you require of them, like "_Choose which platform you would like a link for._"

Then, add another **_Set variable_** action to store the chosen item. Name that variable `Platform`.

![Choose from List action, and setting the choice to a variable named Platform](https://res.cloudinary.com/ds2pg7vex/image/upload/v1620433633/ahmed-jahmi-blog/post_1_image_11_jo4tnc.jpg)

### 6. Get the value of the URL we want to share from the `Data`.

Accessing the value of the URL we want to share will be done by chaining the nested keys with dot notation. For example, if the user chose spotify, the value we want will be located at:

```
linksByPlatform.spotify.url
```

If the user chose appleMusic, the value we want will be located at:

```
linksByPlatform.appleMusic.url
```

etc.

This is why we store the chosen list item in the `Platform` variable, so that this piece of the key is dynamic.

Now let's get the value we need by adding the **_Get Dictionary Value_** action. For the **_Key_** parameter, let's pass in the key of the value we want to access. Replace `<platform>` with our `Platform` variable:

```
linksByPlatform.<Platform>.url
```

And in the **_Dictionary_** parameter, we want to pass in our `Data` variable. Now, let's add a **_Set variable_** action, name it `ShareLink` and set it to the `Dictionary Value` from the **_Get Dictionary Value_** action before.

### 7. Present a menu that offers the options to '_Open_' the `ShareLink` or '_Send in message_'.

- If they choose to '_Open_', open the `ShareLink` in Safari.
- If they choose to '_Send in message_', present a message populated with the `ShareLink` allowing the user to choose a _Recipient_ and send it.

Now that we have the value of the converted link stored in the variable `ShareLink`, we want to give the user two options from which to choose:

1. Open
2. Send in message

And after a decision is made, we'd like to run an action based on that decision. We can do this with the **_Menu_** action.

Let's add the **_Menu_** action. Add _Open_ and _Send in message_ as menu items, and pass a prompt to indicate to the user what you require of them, like "_What would you like to do with the link?_"

![Menu action with Prompt and menu items](https://res.cloudinary.com/ds2pg7vex/image/upload/v1620471689/ahmed-jahmi-blog/post_1_image_13_se7jjc.jpg)

You'll notice there are two blocks after the menu, one for each menu item. After the **_Open_** block, we want to add the action **_Open URLs_**. It has a **_URL_** parameter, so we want to pass in our `ShareLink`.

After the **_Send in message_** block, we want to add the **_Send Message_** action. It has two parameters: **_Message_** and **_Recipient_**. In the **_Message_** param, we want to pass in our `ShareLink`. As for the **_Recipient_** param, we want to leave this blank. Leaving it blank will allow the user to choose who the **_Recipient_** of the message will be.

Finally, we need to add our new shortcut to our iPhone's Share Sheet. The Share Sheet is the menu of options that pop up when you want to share anything in your phone like photos, contacts, links, etc.

Click the menu button at the top right of our new shortcut. This will bring up the details menu of the shortcut. Name the shortcut `SongLink Converter` and toggle the '_Show in Share Sheet_' option on.

Finished! Now let's test it.

### Use Case 1: The user is listening to a song on one platform, and they want to share it to a user of another platform.

Let's open Apple Music, choose a song, click the details button, and then the share song option. This will bring up the Share Sheet and you'll see our `SongLink Converter` shortcut!

Click it to run the shortcut, choose _spotify_ from the list, and _send in message_ from the menu. You should see a new message pop up with the spotify link pasted in.

</p>

### Use Case 2: The user receives a song link to another platform, and they want to open it within the platform they use.

Let's copy the Spotify link. Then, we'll open the Shortcuts app and run our `SongLink Converter` shortcut. Choose _appleMusic_ from the list, and _Open_ from the menu. The song should then open in Apple Music for you to play.

</p>

We're done! Now go forth and enjoy your new shortcut. Share songs without restriction and open whatever song link comes your way, regardless of platform!
