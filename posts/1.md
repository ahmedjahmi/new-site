# Apple Shortcuts

## How to build an Apple Shortcut that generates a share link for any platform. Spotify, Apple Music, etc.

You're listening to a Jay-Z song. You notice he says:

> "Shout out to Nostrand Ave., Flushing Ave., Myrtle. All the County of Kings, may your grounds stay fertile."

You're bestfriend lives in Brooklyn (Kings County) on Nostrand Ave., so you think he'd get excited to hear that. Naturally, you want to share the song with a him.

### The Problem:

You listen to music on Apple Music. Your friend listens to music on Spotify. If you send them an Apple Music link, they'll end their friendship with you because you should already know that they're a Spotify user and there is nothing they can do with that link, other than make note of the song to look up later.

Similarly, the same problem exists for you when they send you a Spotify link.

But what if there was a magic SongLink Converter you can use to send your friend a Spotify link from your Apple Music app?

Or..

If your friend sends you a Spotify link, that same SongLink Converter could magically open that link in Apple Music?

That would be amazing. Let's make that magic SongLink Converter using a shortcut!

Thankfully, there is a website called [odesli.co](https://odesli.co/) that allows you to paste a song link into their search bar and generates links for that song on every major platform. Luckily for us, they have an open API that we can use in our shortcut. All we need to do is make a form a request that contains our link as a query parameter.

Let's get to it..

First, I want to talk about the Apple Shortcuts app. It gives you the ability to run tasks that comprise of _actions_. An _action_ is similar to a _function_ or _method_ in various programming languages like JavaScript or Python. These _actions_ take input and return output, giving you the ability to interact with apps and content on your iOS device, as well as content and services on the web.

### How will our shortcut work?

- We want to a song we're listening to, or a song link copied to our clipboard
- We want to choose that platform we would like to convert the song link to
- We want to receive the link
- We want to choose whether we want to open that link or send it in a message.

Here's how to do it:

First, open the Shortcuts app. Click the '+' icon to add a new shortcut. There, you'll see the option to 'add action'. Here, we'll want to add a conditional _if_ statement. Why? Well because there are two starting points here. Either you'll be sharing a link to another platform **or** you'll be opening a link from another platform. _If_ you're sharing the link, it will be coming from your music app as _shortcut input_. _If_ you're opening a link from another platform, you'll be copying that link to your clipboard so that you can run the shortcut and open it.

So, search for the _if_ action. It should be categorized under "scripting". You'll see it comes with _if_, _otherwise_, and _end if_. For the _if_ part, we want to check if the shortcut input is empty, so choose "Shortcut Input" as the input and the option "does not have any value".

If the shortcut input is empty, that means there should be a value in the clipboard. We want to first, get that value. Then, set a variable equal to that value. There are actions for both of these steps.

In between the _if_ and _otherwise_ parts of the _if_ action, we want to add the "Get clipboard" action. This will, you guessed it, **get** whatever is copied to your clipboard. Then, after the "Get clipboard" action but still before the _otherwise_ part of the _if_ action, add the action "Set variable". We'll name this variable **UrlQuery** because it will the the query parameter we need later for the api request.

Now, in the _otherwise_ part of our _if_ action, we want to handle the scenario where there **is** a value in our shortcut input. Here, we want to also add the "Set variable" action, naming it **UrlQuery** but set to "Shortcut Input" and ending the _if_ action with _End If_.

If we take a look at Odesli's [api documentation](https://www.notion.so/API-d0ebe08a5e304a55928405eb682f6741), the api endpoint is `https://api.song.link/v1-alpha.1/links?` ..so lets add that to a variable for later use as well.

After our completed _if_ action, let's add the action _Text_. In the Text action, paste that api endpoint in. Following the Text action, add another "Set Variable" action. We want to name the variable _SongLinkApi_ and set it to the value of the _Text_ action before it.

Here is where we'll need the user to choose which platform they'd like to generate a link for. Odesli provides links for the pretty much every platform you can think of:

- spotify
- appleMusic
- tidal
- deezer
- youtube
- youtubeMusic
- google
- googleStore
- amazonMusic
- amazonStore
- soundcloud
- pandora
- yandex
- spinrilla
- audius

You'll notice, all the options start with a lowercase letter and are without spaces. This was intentional as it will make things easier later on.

That being said, lets add this list to our shortcut by adding the _List_ action after our SongLinkApi variable. In the list, add each platform as a list item, formatted the way I did above. So _appleMusic_, **not** _Apple Music_. _spotify_, **not** _Spotify_.

Now that we have our list, we want the user to choose from the list. For this, we have the action _Choose from List_. Add that after the _List_ action with our platform options. Then, add another _Set variable_ action to store the chosen item. Name that variable _Platform_ so we can use it later.

**What are all these variables for?**

Well, when we make the request to the SongLinkApi, we are going to recieve a data response that looks like this:

So, we'll need to access the url for the platform the user chose via dot notation. For example, if the user chose _spotify_ as their platform, we'll access that url with the dictionary key

`linksByPlatform.spotify.url`

to get the value of the url.

That being said, let's add another _Text_ action to our shortcut. Here, we are going to add that key, but we will interpolate the platform part of the key using the Platform variable we set earlier. So in the _Text_ action add the following:

`linksByPlatform.Platform.url`

However, where you see _Platform_ in the text above, you should use the Platform variable we set earlier. The option to use our variables should be just above your keyboard where suggestions pop up. Using the Platform variable will allow this text to be dynamic, adding the value of the platform the user chose from the List above.

Again, let's add the _Set Variable_ action after this _Text_ action to save this dictionary key for later use. Let's name it "DictKey".

Ok, it's time to put our api call together using our SongLinkApi and UrlQuery variables. It should look like this:

`<SongLinkApi>url=<UrlQuery>`

..where SongLinkApi is Odesli's api endpoint url we set as a variable earlier, and the key-value pair we need to pass the api. We're trying to pass the url of the song we're converting, so our UrlQuery variable holds that value. And because it is a url, we use the `url=` key. Once interpolated, our api call should look like:

```
https://api.song.link/v1-alpha.1/links?url=https://music.apple.com/us/album/marcy-me/1440935425?i=1440935876
https://music.apple.com/us/album/marcy-me/1440935425?i=1440935876
```

To accomplish this, we'll add another _Text_ action. In the action add:

`SongLinkApi`url=`UrlQuery`

Then add a _Set variable_ action and name it "ApiCall".

Now we have to make a request to `ApiCall`. We'll do that using the _Get contents of_ action. After adding this action, it should read: _Get contents of `ApiCall`_

This will return a dictionary of data, so let's add another action called _Get dictionary from_. This action should now read: _Get dictionary from `Contents of Url`_.

This dictionary contains all the links for every platform, but we only need the one that the user chose from the list. So let's use our `DictKey` variable we made earlier to get the link we want from the dictionary.

We do this by adding the action _Get Dictionary Value_. After adding the action, it should read: _Get `Value` for `DictKey` in `Dictionary`_. Then, let's store this in a variable. Add a `Set variable` action, it should read: _Set variable `ShareLink` to `Dictionary Value`_

Now that we have the `ShareLink` we've all been waiting for..does the user want to _send it in a message_? Or do they want to _open it_?

Both are valid questions, so how about we ask the user to decide? We can use the _Choose from Menu_ action for that. It presents a menu of options, and then based on your choice from the menu, run some more actions. Similar to how we used the _If, Otherwise, End If_ action earlier.

Add the _Choose from Menu_ action. We can set a prompt to display to the user when the shortcut gets to this step. Let's add one that says:

`What would you like to do with this link?`

Add the menu items `Open it` and `Send it in a message`.

Now, notice that the _Choose from Menu_ action has two trailing cards: `Open it` and `Send it in a message` just like `If` and `Otherwise`.

So if the user chooses `Open it`, let's add the action `Open URLs`. Pass the `ShareLink` variable into the action so that it reads: _Open `ShareLink`_.

This will open the link, which will ultimately redirect to the app the link associates to. So now, that Spotify link you copied from your friend..you can run the shortcut and open in in Apple Music, or vice versa.

But what if the user chose `Send it in a message`? That's right! Let's add the _Send Message_ action. And instead of passing the `ShareLink` to open it like in the last action, we'll pass the `ShareLink` to the _Send Message_ action and leave the `Recipients` blank, giving the user the option to choose which contacts or groups to send it to.

The _Choose from Menu_ action should end there with _End Menu_.
